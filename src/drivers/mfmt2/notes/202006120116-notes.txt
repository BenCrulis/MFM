Fri Jun 12 01:17:00 2020 Well we finally moved the ulam5 branch, and
the mfmt2 branch, onto develop.  And that's now seeming to settle
down, although I expect a few lingering explosions or overlooked bits
will turn up occasionally.

In any case, for ages we have been doing notes for itcSpike12 in the
T2-12 tree, which really does seem just wrong for all this MFM tree
development, so I'm starting up this notes file here in honor of
merging to develop.

TODO:

 - Rework the Tile menu to pull in the old CPU freq changing stuff[2:
   Fri Jun 12 03:06:32 2020 Which turned out to be nothing more than a
   system() call.. :2]

[5: Fri Jun 12 03:59:13 2020
DONE :5] - Pull in the CPU freq changing stuff sufficient to start slowing the
   clock when the core temperature goes high.[3: Making another
   TimeoutAble to watch the core temp and control the CPU..  :3]

   = core temp ACCEPTABLE -> 1000MHz
   = core temp HIGH -> 720MHz
   = core temp

 - Consider ditching the circuit abstraction.  With each ITC having a
   rack of passive EWs, aren't 16 active EWs really enough?  We could
   ensure we reserve one for hidden events if we wanted, right?  So if
   there's only one active EW left, we reject any centers that would
   require locks?
