Tue Dec 29 04:14:04 2020 Well it's beginning to look a lot like
intertile.

Time to start roughing out a plan to get libcue.so's sucked into mfmt2
and controlling events.

After second sleep.

Some questions:

 - Can we do flash traffic without compatible mfzids?  We want to.

 - How are we going to specify what physics to run?  We want it to be
   sticky -- we need to boot into some last-specified physics.  Maybe
   that does argue for shipping the config by cdm.  Would be nice if
   we could pre-position a new config via cdm but then activate it
   somehow via flash traffic.

(Also, there's an issue that flash traffic for mfmt2 pause appears to
blow up the engine.  That needs to be looked at.)[1:

Thu Dec 31 01:57:12 2020 (Have had a hacked-up DReg/Res running for
19h now on the 1.75PZ grid.  It's looking pretty equilibrated.  Center 
tile samples:

empty%  mAER
62      390
61      360
63      400
63      410
52      300
57      340
60      370
61      360
61      380
59      380

59.9    369.0 avg

Looks like we could be saying something like

   350 mAER (IS,DR/R) IS ACHIEVED

0.350 an AER, indefinitely scalable, on DReg/Res physics, is achieved

0.35 of an event per site per second, on average, indefinitely
scalable, on DReg/Res physics, is achieved.

Thu Dec 31 04:11:46 2020 So.  For getting to try ulam in mfmt2

 - Command line changes: arg name?
   = Repurpose -z?
   = Is slot number + timestamp enough?
   = If we had some internal token we could allow events across
     upgrades?  Terrible idea, I think.  Mostly it just moves the pink
     bathtub ring to the management of the 'internal token' namespace.
   = Let's say a cdmss file name, for one of the reserved slots a0-bf
     IS the physics ID.  Just 31 slots, eh?  What about a0-ef, with
     f0-ff explicitly reserved for 'temp physics', whatever that
     means, and 00-9f reserved for 'system use', whatever that means?
   = So, '-z CDMSSNAME' for physics, with slot a0-ef.
   = If we get a relative path, we look for it in /cdm/common
   = Or, is all this happening in a script around mfmt2?  And mfmt2
     might have just -z TAG and -ep libcue.so?
   = Is it happening in mfm.sh?  Since that is, after all, ..
   = So suppose we reserve slot 04 for physics configuration?  Have it
     be a tiny little file containing the cdmss physics ID that is to
     be run, and perhaps some other metadata -- to be elaborated --
     about the run.
   = What do we do when we install 04?  Just unpack it somewhere?  Are
     we comfortable splitting all the crypto from the actual running
     of the physics?

Sun Jan  3 12:17:24 2021 Well, that's just a start at the ulam-on-t2
design issues.  But all that's going to have to wait for the next
cycle, for t2sup#292.

Committing this stuff.
